| [**Scan repository with build as a pre-step (Recommended)**](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/full-scan) | This recommended method ensures SAST analysis on compiled code and artifacts through a pre-build step for comprehensive vulnerability detection | [Workflow](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/full-scan/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) |[Results](https://blackducksca-workflow-examples.github.io/full-scan/) |                                                                                         
| [**PR Comments**](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/pr-comments) | For each new vulnerable component that the developer introduces with his/her changes, this integration is capable of adding a comment to the pull request. PR comments enable the developer to quickly view, understand and fix the issue before merging the pull request | [Workflow](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/pr-comments/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://blackducksca-workflow-examples.github.io/pr-comments/) |                                                                                     
| [**Create Automatic FixPRs**](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/automatic-fixpr) | Fix PR feature automatically creates PRs for vulnerable components found in the scan. This sample shows how you can configure the fix PR feature | [Workflow](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/automatic-fixpr/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://blackducksca-workflow-examples.github.io/automatic-fixpr/) |                                                                            
| [**Generate Sarif Reports**](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/sarif-generation) | Security report generation in SARIF format | [Workflow](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/sarif-generation/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://blackducksca-workflow-examples.github.io/sarif-generation/) |                                                                          
| [**Build Break**](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/build-break) | The ability to break or not break a build when policy violations are found is configurable. This sample shows you how to configure the build break options |  [Workflow](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/build-break/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://blackducksca-workflow-examples.github.io/build-break/) |                                                                                    
| [**Branch Scans (Buildless Method)**](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/install-directory-custom-paths) | This option is less accurate and should be used when you canâ€™t build your repository | [Workflow](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/install-directory-custom-paths/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://blackducksca-workflow-examples.github.io/install-directory-custom-paths/) |                                               
| [**Passing Detect tool arguments from Black Duck Sca scans**](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/arbitrary-params) | Custom parameter configurations |  [Workflow](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/arbitrary-params/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://blackducksca-workflow-examples.github.io/arbitrary-params/) |                                                                           
| [**Asynchronous Mode**](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/async-mode) | Asynchronous scanning mode | [Workflow](https://github.com/blackducksca-workflow-examples/async-mode/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://blackducksca-workflow-examples.github.io/async-mode/) |
